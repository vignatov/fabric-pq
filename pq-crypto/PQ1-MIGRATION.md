# PQ1: ML-DSA-65 migration and compatibility

## Status

The implementation migrates the PQ signing wrapper to the Go standard-library
`crypto/mldsa` API and pins the root module toolchain to Go 1.27.4. This report
is a work-in-progress validation record: the PQ and MSP after-change tests have
been reported passing, but the standalone BCCSP test and full Fabric suite have
not been rerun. Do not treat this branch as release-ready until the remaining
validation and review are complete.

## Baseline

- Baseline commit: `19a9bbb3684e636a430e181535ecf421e46b077d`.
- Feature branch: `feature/pq1-ml-dsa65`.
- Environment: WSL Ubuntu 24.04, Go 1.27.4, GCC 13.3.0. Docker was unavailable.
- Baseline commands and outcomes:
  - `go test -short ./pq-crypto` — passed (`7.608s`).
  - `go test ./msp` — passed (`5.708s`).
  - `go test -mod=readonly ./bccsp/sw` in a temporary Go workspace joining the
    root and local `fabric-lib-go` modules — passed (`0.635s`).
- `make unit-test` was not run because it requires Docker.
- The temporary BCCSP workspace was removed; module hashes were unchanged.

Post-change commands and outcomes, reported by the user from the WSL feature
branch checkout:

- `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.27.4 go test -short ./pq-crypto` — passed (`ok` reported;
  timing/output details not supplied).
- `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.27.4 go test ./msp` — passed (`ok` reported; timing/output
  details not supplied).
- `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.27.4 go test -mod=readonly ./bccsp/sw` — not rerun after the
  change.
- `make unit-test` — not run; Docker is unavailable.

The two reported passing commands ran before the follow-up review fixes for
unsupported ML-DSA parameter sets and the hybrid byte fixture. Rerun
`GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.27.4 go test -short ./pq-crypto` to validate those additions.

The WSL checkout at `~/fabric-pq` was confirmed to be on `main`, not the feature
branch. The reported post-change results apply to the feature-branch checkout
at `/mnt/c/Users/cogdev/source/repos/private/fabric-pq`.

## Backend assessment

The implementation selects Go's standard-library `crypto/mldsa` on the pinned
Go 1.27.4 toolchain instead of liboqs 0.16.0. This provides FIPS 204 ML-DSA-65
key generation, seed import, signing, verification, and standard PKIX/PKCS#8
key encoding without cgo, a separately built native library, or bundled
platform binaries. liboqs 0.16.0 is a viable maintained alternative and
includes `mldsa-native`, but would retain native toolchain, distribution, and
platform-specific build requirements not needed by this repository's current
Go implementation.

The standard-library backend has no separate Go module checksum to pin: its
implementation is fixed by the Go toolchain. The root module declares
`toolchain go1.27.4`. Reproducibility still requires using that exact Go
toolchain and the repository's normal dependency-locking/build process.

## Versioned signing profile

`MLDSA65ProfileV1` names the following fixed profile:

- Algorithm: FIPS 204 ML-DSA-65, **pure ML-DSA**.
- Context: the empty string.
- Input: the exact byte slice received by the PQ signer. This profile does not
  reinterpret a supplied digest as HashML-DSA or hash it a second time.
- Legacy names such as `Dilithium3` are rejected. `DEFAULT` is retained only as
  a source-compatibility alias for this one ML-DSA-65 profile; algorithm
  selection does not depend on liboqs ordering.

Existing Fabric call semantics are preserved. For non-Ed25519 MSP identities,
MSP hashes the message according to its configured signature hash family before
passing those digest bytes to the PQ signer. For Ed25519 identities it passes
the message bytes. In the existing hybrid identity signature, the PQ signer
signs those bytes first; the classical signer signs SHA-384 over the
concatenation of those same bytes and the PQ signature. The alternate-key
certificate helper continues to sign its existing DER-encoded key-material
message directly. Context and domain-separation behavior have not been
silently changed.

## Identifiers and encodings

ML-DSA-65 uses RFC 9881's NIST OID
`2.16.840.1.101.3.4.3.18`. RFC 9881 requires absent parameters; encoders omit
them and the alternate public-key parser rejects a present parameter value.
The public-key bit string contains the raw FIPS 204 ML-DSA-65 public-key bytes.
Private keys are encoded as PKCS#8 using the RFC 9881 seed representation.

This does **not** make Fabric's existing hybrid certificate format RFC 9881
compliant. The alternate public key and signature still use the existing
custom extensions (`2.5.29.71`, `.72`, `.73`) associated with a draft format.
The extension currently embeds an RFC 9881 ML-DSA `SubjectPublicKeyInfo`, but
the hybrid certificate construction and validation remain custom and are not a
standardized hybrid profile.

## Compatibility and rollout

- Existing Dilithium3 keys, certificates, and signatures are not compatible
  with ML-DSA and are rejected; there is no classical fallback.
- This migration targets a fresh demonstration network only: generate a new
  genesis block and regenerate demonstration identities and keys before use.
- Targeted searches of `sampleconfig` and `integration` found no committed PQ
  demonstration keys or Dilithium/OQS references to regenerate in those trees.
  Any locally generated network artifacts must still be recreated.
- Historical signature verification is not claimed. Any future legacy
  verify-only support needs a separate compatibility decision, implementation,
  and tests; legacy signing must remain disabled.
- Standard RFC 9881 ML-DSA certificate and private-key encodings do not
  standardize Fabric's hybrid extensions or its existing nested signature
  structure.

## Tests and vectors

The focused tests include key/signature size checks, successful signing and
verification, wrong message/key and modified signature rejection, malformed
keys, unsupported profile rejection, RFC 9881 OID/absent-parameter checks, and
PKIX/PKCS#8 round trips. PKCS#8 import now rejects ML-DSA-44 and ML-DSA-87
instead of labeling them ML-DSA-65. A hybrid alternate-signature input fixture
pins the DER field order and exact bytes passed to the signer.

The ML-DSA-65 deterministic signing test uses C2SP/Wycheproof
`testvectors_v1/mldsa_65_sign_seed_test.json`, tcId 1 (`baseline`), pinned at
commit `20b256949ea8f21a11375619b1825027ca0668bd` and Git blob
`ff302e20c0b847e66fdcc7444cd63fc1cd7bf634`. The vector's omitted context means
the empty/default context. The checked seed is
`2a` repeated 32 times; the expected derived public-key SHA-256 is
`b7acce2ddb11f8cc1aa46e2bafac6eacfa2b732ef192bd636ad8d3a56d649c66`, and the
expected deterministic signature SHA-256 is
`39fbbb0d97a52c79844213b325af823a7f16a174e00a5b3daeb3e6e6d1c89681`.
The source repository is Apache-2.0 licensed.

The standalone BCCSP command remains to be run:

```text
GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.27.4 go test -mod=readonly ./bccsp/sw
```

The BCCSP command requires a temporary Go workspace joining the root and local
`fabric-lib-go` modules, as it did for the baseline. Full Fabric unit tests,
race tests, and performance tests have not been run after the change.

## Security limitations and unresolved work

- This is not a FIPS 140-3 validated module claim. Go documents ML-DSA as
  unavailable in FIPS module v1.0 mode; errors must propagate, without fallback.
- The implementation has not received a dedicated cryptographic review or
  side-channel analysis. Go's key API exposes the seed bytes for serialization;
  zeroization guarantees are not established here.
- The vendored liboqs native binaries were removed. The now-unused headers under
  `pq-crypto/include/oqs` remain pending authorization to remove them; they are
  not used by the new Go implementation.
- Existing hybrid signing retains no explicit protocol/domain tag and uses the
  current nested-signature construction. This behavior is deliberately
  preserved for PQ1; changing it requires a separately specified and tested
  migration.
- ML-DSA support is pinned to Go 1.27.4. Consumers must use a toolchain
  containing `crypto/mldsa`; older toolchains cannot build this package.

## PQ2: certificate and MSP modernization

1. Specify a versioned, standards-based hybrid certificate profile, including
   algorithm identifiers, extension encoding, criticality, and signer/issuer
   validation requirements. Do not equate RFC 9881 ML-DSA identifiers with
   standardized hybrid certificates.
2. Define certificate, private-key, MSP, and trust-anchor migration behavior
   for existing ledgers and certificates. Explicitly decide whether any
   legacy verification-only path is required.
3. Regenerate and validate demonstration CA/MSP identities and genesis
   artifacts under the approved profile.
4. Bind signature algorithms and parameters to the profile in certificate
   validation; test malformed, duplicate, unsupported, downgraded, and mixed
   classical/PQ chains.
5. Add independent full ML-DSA verification vectors and end-to-end BCCSP/MSP
   hybrid regression tests in the supported build environment.
